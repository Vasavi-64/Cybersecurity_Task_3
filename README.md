Task 3 – Web Application Security Task

ApexPlanet Cybersecurity Internship

This repository contains the deliverables for Task 3 of the ApexPlanet Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship, focused on Web Application Security.

🔍 Overview

The task involved performing a security assessment on a vulnerable web application — Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) — to identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities.

🧠 Vulnerabilities Explored

SQL Injection (SQLI)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)


Each vulnerability includes detailed attack scenarios, step-by-step exploitation methods, and mitigation techniques.

🧰 Tools & Methodology

Kali Linux – Attacker machine for testing

DVWA – Target web application

Burp Suite – Intercepting and modifying HTTP requests

Manual Testing – Direct interaction with input fields and requests


📁 Repository Contents

SQLI_Attack_Scenario.md – SQL Injection attack and mitigation

XSS_Attack_Scenario.md – Cross-Site Scripting attack and mitigation

CSRF_Attack_Scenario.md – Cross-Site Request Forgery attack and mitigation

Supporting scripts and files used for demonstrations


🛡️ Key Takeaways

This task highlights the importance of input validation, output encoding, and secure session handling in preventing common web application vulnerabilities.
